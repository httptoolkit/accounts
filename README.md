# HTTP Toolkit Accounts

This repo contains a selection of Netlify functions that power HTTP Toolkit account management (purchases, password reset, etc).

This isn't really relevant to most users of HTTP Toolkit, and runs separately to the downloaded application, it's effectively internal back office logic.

It's open anyway, because it's always interesting to see how business's internals really work, enjoy.
