# HTTP Toolkit Internals

This repo contains a selection of Netlify functions that power various internal httptoolkit.tech services.

This isn't really relevant to users of HTTP Toolkit, and isn't part of the downloaded application. This repo contains back office logic, like subscription management.

It's open anyway, because it's always interesting to see how business's internals really work.
